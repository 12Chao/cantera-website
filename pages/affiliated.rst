      Packages in the Cantera ecosystem

While Cantera provides some standalone models and applications, numerous external packages
exist that provide more specialized functionality and rely on Cantera. Here we provide a
non-exhaustive, alphabetical, list of these packages; if you would like us to include your package, please
`submit a pull request <https://github.com/cantera/cantera-website/pulls>`__,
`file an issue <https://github.com/cantera/cantera-website/issues/new>`__, or
post on the `Google Users' Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cantera-users>`__.

------------

**ASALI**: graphical user interface for calculating properties using Cantera.

| `Repository <https://github.com/srebughini/ASALI>`__

------------

**BIOVIA Materials Studio**: commercial modeling and simulation software for materials science and chemistry.

| `Website <https://www.3dsbiovia.com/products/collaborative-science/biovia-materials-studio/>`__

------------

**Ember**: a quasi-one-dimensional, unsteady reacting flow solver that can simulate a number of fundamental flame configurations: premixed laminar flames, opposed-flow strained flames (premixed or diffusion), axisymmetric (tubular) flames with positive or negative curvature, and steady 2D flames in a prescribed velocity field.
