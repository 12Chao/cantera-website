# KinCodeCon 2018

Thanks to the support of [NumFOCUS] via a
[small development grant](https://numfocus.org/blog/fall-2018-open-source-development-grants),
the [Cantera Steering Committee](/governance.html#current-steering-committee) met in
person on MIT's campus in Cambridge, MA, at the 3rd Annual KinCodeCon on June 16â€“18.
Despite inclement weather throwing off

The Steering Committee met virtually in 2016 and 2017 to discuss issues and plan for the future,
and while we tried to include some live code sprinting, the virtual nature of the meetings made
this challenging. (It was also challenging to block off more than a few hours at a time when
at our respective homes/institutions.)
